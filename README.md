## ‚ú® Features
- **Realistic Physics**: Elastic collisions, gravity, and momentum conservation
- **Dynamic Escape Mechanism**: Rotating arc that allows balls to escape
- **Particle System**: Automatic ball generation and destruction
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Uses NumPy for precise vector calculations
- **Visual Appeal**: Colorful balls with random colors

## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame 2.5.1
- NumPy 1.24.3

## üéÆ How It Works
- Balls start inside the circle with random velocities
- They bounce elastically off the circle's boundaries
- Gravity pulls them downward
- A rotating arc periodically allows balls to escape
- When a ball escapes, two new balls are generated

## üî¨ Technical Details
- **Physics Engine**: Custom implementation using vector mathematics
- **Collision Detection**: Precise circle-boundary collision algorithms
- **Coordinate System**: Cartesian with NumPy array optimization
- **Rendering**: Pygame for real-time visualization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- The simulation may crash after extended runtime due to exponential ball growth
- This is intentional for demonstration purposes
